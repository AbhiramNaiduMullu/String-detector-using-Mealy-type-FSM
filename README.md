# String-detector-using-Mealy-type-FSM
The aim of the experiment is to design a string detector using Mealy type FSM which will detect the occurrence of ‘covid’ word in a string of letters. a Mealy machine is a finite-state machine whose output values are determined both by its current state and the current inputs. Alphabets were coded into five bit binary numbers. These numbers are given as input to the design and design outputs a ‘1’ if the required word is detected otherwise it’s output is ‘0’. For instance, ”lclolvlildl” is the input text then the output sequence would be ”00000000010”.
